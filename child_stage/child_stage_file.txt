BOATSWAIN  Do you not hear him? You mar our labor.
Keep your cabins. You do assist the storm.

GONZALO  Nay, good, be patient.

BOATSWAIN  When the sea is. Hence! What cares these
roarers for the name of king? To cabin! Silence!
Trouble us not.

GONZALO  Good, yet remember whom thou hast
aboard.

BOATSWAIN  None that I more love than myself. You are
a councillor; if you can command these elements
to silence, and work the peace of the present, we
will not hand a rope more. Use your authority. If
you cannot, give thanks you have lived so long, and
make yourself ready in your cabin for the mischance
of the hour, if it so hap.—Cheerly, good
hearts!—Out of our way, I say!

                            He exits.

GONZALO  I have great comfort from this fellow. Methinks
he hath no drowning mark upon him. His
complexion is perfect gallows. Stand fast, good
Fate, to his hanging. Make the rope of his destiny
our cable, for our own doth little advantage. If he be
not born to be hanged, our case is miserable.

                            He exits with Alonso, Sebastian,
                            and the other courtiers.
